##Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data: 
This codebook analyses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (Anguita et al., 2013) to provide a tidy dataset for the course project in *Getting and Cleaning Data* (Leek et al., 2015).

##Contents of repository
This repository includes the following files:
* **Readme.md** - this file, containing information relating to the repository.
* **TidySmartphoneData.txt** - a tab delimited version of the tidy dataset. Instructions on how to read this are given below.
* **CodeBook.md** - A description of the data measurements and data dictionary describing the structure and fields within *TidySmartphoneData.txt* 
* **run_analysis.R** - the R script used to produce the dataset contained in TidySmartphoneData.txt.  Instructions on how to run this are given below.

##Tidy Data
Leek et al. (2015) state that either *wide* or *long* versions of a tidy dataset are acceptable.  The wide version contains each measurement as a category.  The long version treats these categories as variables which can be placed within a "Measurements" category.  There is, however, a third form: a *short long* version.
Data measurements are generally summarised using both the mean (as a measure of central tendency) and the standard deviation (as a measure of the spread of the data from the centre) - or as a scientist may say "accuracy and reproducibility".  
It is important to note that these aspects of data measurement are linked, and not independent.  Thus the long version could be perceived as a non-tidy data form because the Measurements category contains variables of mean and standard deviation mixed together.  
The tidy data set in this repository recognises the relationship between mean and standard deviation within these grouped measurements, further separating the data into distinct columns.  The result is a true tidy data set which pairs the mean and standard deviation with the reading for each subject and activity.

##Looking at the data
The tidy dataset is a tab-delimited text file which can be loaded into R using the command:
`read.table("myTidyData.txt", header=TRUE)` or the more precise version:
`read.table(file="myTidyData.txt", header=TRUE, sep=" ")`

##Verifying the data
The script file *run_analysis.R* contains code that describes the function *run_analysis()*.  Executing this function will download the data, convert it to a tidy version and save the result in a file called *TidySmartphoneData*.

##How the script works
1. Download the compressed [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to a temporary file, uncompress the data and delete the temporary file.
2. Using this data, load and merge elements from the training and test subsets to create unified versions of the data (*myData*), subject (*mySubjects*) and activity (*myActivities*) indexes.
3. Load the index of data recordings and parse these to identify measurements relating to mean and standard deviation. Use this to extract these columns from the data set.
4. Merge this data with the subject and activity indexes along with descriptive labels for each category.
5. Aggregate the data to provide an average response for each measurement grouped by activity and subject.
6. Modify category names to clearly differentiate records containing a mean or standard deviation and remove "mean()" and "std" from the middle of measurement labels. 
7. Gather all the measurement variables into a single column to create a tidy data set (*myTidyData*) using the long format.
8. Separate the measurement name from the data method (ie. mean or std) using the tags developed in step 6.
9  Use the method column to spread the measurement values across separate columns of "Mean"" and "Standard_deviation"" for each combination of subject and activity.
10. Substitute descriptive activity names for activities in the data set.
11. Write the tidy data set to a separate file (*TidySmartphoneData.txt*)
